### Code Explanation

In this code, the `malloc()` function is used to dynamically allocate an array named `arr`, and the `free()` function is used to release the allocated memory. Dynamic memory allocation allows the program to flexibly allocate memory during runtime, efficiently managing memory usage. However, it is crucial to free the allocated memory after use to prevent memory leaks. Failure to do so may lead to memory leaks, impacting system performance.
