**`ALU`**

-   This code defines an ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) simulation, which includes functions for shift operations, add/subtract operations, logic operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOR), and a set less than operation.

**`Memory`**

-   This code includes functions to simulate memory access and a main function.
-   Memory is divided into three regions: program area, data area, and stack area.
-   These functions allow reading and writing a desired number of bytes in each of these regions.
